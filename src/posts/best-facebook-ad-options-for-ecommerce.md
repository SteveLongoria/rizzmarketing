## Dynamic Ads

Dynamic Ads are a powerful tool for your eCommerce business on Facebook. This type of ad allows companies to show personalized ads based on users' browsing or purchasing requests and other online behaviour. This means ads will be tailored to reach the right audience, increasing the chances of conversion. By targeting people who have left items in their abandoned carts, you can retarget potential leads with ads showing the exact items they viewed on your website. This is an effective way to encourage customers to complete their purchase. You can also use retargeting strategies to convert eCommerce website visitors into actual customers. By tracking outbound clicks on your ads and comparing them with sales, you can optimize your landing pages to create a user-friendly solution that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate. To sum it up, Dynamic Ads offer a highly personalized advertising experience, allowing you to reach the right audience with the right message. By using retargeting strategies and optimizing your landing pages, you can take full advantage of this powerful tool and boost your eCommerce sales on Facebook.

## Collection Ads

Collection Ads: These ads showcase several images or videos in a sequence, making it easier for users to browse and purchase multiple products in a single ad. If you want to promote various solutions or showcase your vast product catalog, collection ads are an excellent choice. Users can view the products and choose the ones they like, leading to increased sales and engagement. Furthermore, collection ads are designed for mobile devices, making them easy to view and interact with on the go. By incorporating collection ads into your Facebook ad strategy, you can promote more products and engage more customers.

## Video Ads

Facebook video ads are an effective way to promote and demonstrate your products or services in action. Whether you're featuring a new product or showcasing how your service works, video ads can help you grab attention and increase engagement. There are different types of Facebook videos that you can use, including product demos, customer testimonials, and brand stories. However, it's important to make sure that your video content is attention-grabbing and visually appealing. Keep it short and sweet, but also make sure it's informative and entertaining. With the right strategy, video ads can be a great way to generate leads and increase sales for your ecommerce business.

## Messenger Ads

Messenger Ads on Facebook are an effective tool for any eCommerce business as it connects to a highly engaged audience through personalized interactions. This type of ad focuses on building a personal connection with users, increasing engagement through conversation and allowing for automation and direct purchases within the application. Messenger Ads can be automated by bots and respond to customers' inquiries, providing direct support. It is also a convenient and trackable way to connect with customers. Leveraging the user engagement level of Facebook Messenger for your branding efforts can be a valuable asset that leads the customers towards the right actions as per your business goals. If you're looking to enhance your eCommerce business' customer support and scalability, Messenger Ads must become a part of your marketing strategy.

## Lead Ads

Lead ads are an effective way to generate leads quickly. By using fill-in forms, businesses can gather important information from potential customers. This can include name, email, phone number and even interests. The best part about lead ads is that they allow users to fill out fields within the ad, making the process quick and easy. Moreover, lead ads are an excellent way to acquire new customers. With the information gathered, businesses can create a connection with potential customers and offer personalized solutions.
