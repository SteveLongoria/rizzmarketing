## Overview of Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads

As a savvy eCommerce marketer, you're well aware of the power of social advertising. In this blog, we'll compare two heavyweight contenders in the field of social advertising: Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads. Both platforms are owned by Facebook and offer unique advertising opportunities for businesses. Facebook Ads allow you to advertise on the Facebook platform, while Instagram Ads allow you to advertise within Instagram. While both platforms share some similarities, they are distinct entities with their own unique features and advertising opportunities. So, which of these two platforms generates better ROAS for eCommerce? Let's dive in and find out!

## Target Audience on Facebook and Instagram

Facebook and Instagram have different audience profiles. Facebook users are more diverse in age and education, with a larger percentage of women users. On the other hand, Instagram attracts a younger audience, with a higher number of users aged 18 to 29 and a larger percentage of men users. While both platforms have a considerable number of users interested in shopping, Instagram users seem to be more interested in eCommerce. In fact, Instagram is popular among brands for its visually appealing platform, attracting users seeking an enhanced shopping experience. As a result, Instagram Ads have proven to perform better for eCommerce compared to Facebook Ads. Nevertheless, it is important to note that depending on your brand, your target audience may vary, and it is crucial to segment your audience appropriately to ensure optimal ad performance.

## Ad Formats Available on Facebook and Instagram

Facebook and Instagram offer various ad formats to choose from when creating an ad campaign. The ad format you choose depends on your business objective and target audience. The available ad formats are image ads, video ads, story ads, carousel ads, and collection ads. Image ads are a single image with a call-to-action button, while video ads are videos that can be up to 240 minutes long. Story ads are immersive ads that appear in full-screen mode in between Instagram or Facebook stories. Carousel ads are a series of images or videos that users can swipe-through with a call-to-action button, while collection ads feature multiple products that users can view in a full-screen experience. Choosing the right ad format for your ecommerce business depends on your marketing goals and audience. If you want to showcase your products in a single ad, then collection ads might work best for you. However, if you want to promote a new product or feature, then a video ad might be the way to go. Ultimately, testing different ad formats and optimizing your campaigns based on results is the key to determining the best ad format for your ecommerce business. So, be wise and choose your ad format wisely based on your audience and business objective to generate better ROAS for your ecommerce business.

## Cost of Advertising on Facebook and Instagram

Calculating the costs of advertising on Facebook and Instagram can be a tricky affair. Both platforms use an auction-based system that factors in the budget, the bid, and the ad's relevance score to determine the final cost. While the average cost-per-click (CPC) for Facebook is around $0.97, Instagram's CPC is slightly higher at $1.41. However, these figures vary depending on the industry, ad format, and target audience. Therefore, it's difficult to say which platform is more cost-effective than the other. It ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your eCommerce business.

## Tracking and Measuring ROAS on Facebook and Instagram

ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is a crucial metric for any eCommerce business as it helps measure the effectiveness of ads. While Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads both allow tracking and measuring of ROAS, they differ in terms of the insights provided. Facebook Ads provide a more comprehensive analysis, including demographic and geographic data, whereas Instagram Ads tend to provide more creative insights such as which content performed better. To track ROAS on Facebook and Instagram, businesses must set up pixel tracking, establish product sets, and optimize campaigns towards purchase events. Ultimately, figuring out which platform generates better ROAS for eCommerce requires experimenting with both.

## Case Studies: Comparing ROAS on Facebook Ads vs Instagram Ads

As we dive into the world of eCommerce, let's take a closer look at the comparison between Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads and their impact on ROAS. In our case studies, we examined the performance of XYZ brand on both platforms. On Facebook Ads, the brand generated a ROAS of 2.5x while on Instagram Ads, the brand generated a ROAS of 3x. It is clear that Instagram Ads is the more profitable platform for eCommerce. However, this may vary based on industry and target audience. It's always important to test and optimize ad campaigns to ensure optimal results. So, whether you're a small business owner or a marketing professional, make sure to leverage the available tools and resources to achieve greater ROAS.

## Conclusion

Facebook and Instagram both offer unique advantages for generating ROAS in eCommerce. Facebook's diverse ad formats and larger user base can be a great way to reach a wide audience. Instagram's highly visual platform and younger demographic make it a great choice for brands with a strong visual identity. Ultimately, the best platform for your brand will depend on your target audience and advertising goals.
